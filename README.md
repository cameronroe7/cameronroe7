**About me**

I like to use computers to solve problems. My goal is to create open-source software for use in aerodynamic research and design work to hopefully replace some of the legacy solutions used in the industry, as well as general computing productivity tools to make my life easier. 

**Languages / software skills**
Most of my experience is in MATLAB programming, but I also have experience in Python scripting using Numpy and Scipy. Currently, I'm learning Julia and C - I think Julia is the future of MATLAB-style numerical scripting using mathematically-inspired syntax, and C remains the most direct way to give a computer instructions. 

I've also embraced LaTeX for document preparation, and am in general in favor of anything that produces high-quality results with a minimum of fuss. With that in mind, I have experience writing long technical documents in Word, as well as advanced spreadsheet scripting in Excel. 

**Interests and hobbies**
On my personal computer, I dual-boot Windows 10 and Linux Mint; in the future, I plan on moving to Linux exclusively. As the desktop wanes in popularity in favor of increasingly closed-down walled gardens in the mobile computing sector, I want to support free operating systems that respect the user's rights.

My other interests include chess (I am a proponent of 1. d4 and the Budapest Gambit) and baseball. Go Cardinals!
